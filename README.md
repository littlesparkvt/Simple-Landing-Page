Simple Landing
=========

Simple Landing is a clean, responsive coming soon landing page built with Bootstrap. It was built for businesses and developers.

It has a countdown timer and jquery validated php email form. Both are super simple to change. Just change a few numbers and add your own email address and you're off!

It will only take you a few minutes to set up this template and have a splash page for your upcoming project.

Open config.php and you can set:
// Page title
$pageTitle = "Simple Landing page";
// Countdown Timer
$releaseDate = "2013-02-22";
// Company Name
$companyName = "Company Name";
// Email to delivery
$companyEmail = "name@company.com";
// Url to your company
$companyUrl = "http://www.company.com";
